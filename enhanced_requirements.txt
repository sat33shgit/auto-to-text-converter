# Enhanced Audio to Text Converter Requirements

# Core speech recognition (primary engine)
openai-whisper

# Optional: For creating test audio files
pyttsx3

# Built-in Python libraries (no installation needed):
# - http.server (for web interface)
# - threading (for background processing)
# - json (for data exchange)
# - base64 (for audio encoding)
# - queue (for live transcription)
# - tempfile (for temporary audio files)
# - os, urllib, traceback (utilities)

# Note: The enhanced converter uses only Python built-in libraries
# plus Whisper for maximum compatibility and minimal dependencies
