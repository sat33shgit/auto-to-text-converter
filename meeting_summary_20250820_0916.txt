## Potential Action Items
1. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I've fought with it. OK, the link. OK, so I think this call we wanted to touch base on the slides that you are creating or analysis that you're coming up with. Maybe if you want to bring that up, and I can provide you some feedback in terms of what exactly we are looking from employee day one perspective, right? OK. Yeah. One minute. OK. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Luckily, I could save this as a separate document before Tegan removed all the slides. So I could save this. Yeah. So these are the kind of three slides I have created. Yeah. I see. I would do one thing, right? For you, let's say the target is employee day one, right? Which we are saying it will happen on NT one plus 30. Correct. Yeah. So what you do is you start that view. These slides are really good in terms of adding on the content in terms of support content of those. So create one slide. A copy pays the slide and create one before this one. Just create a new slide. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, let me take out all the content and just put a one single line on top which talks about which is like a timeline view, like a single deadline. Like we have in our timeline view, NT one, LD two something like that, right? So you create two milestones sort of you create. PNT one, preparation and then you put up a milestone, LD one and then LD one plus 30. And then put LD two. These are the four things that will be your your slide will be vertically divided into four parts. So what is P pre pre premise pre HD one? Yeah. LD one is a milestone. It will be just one milestone. It cannot be a phase, right? 3 LD one is a phase. LD one is a milestone. LD one plus 30 is another phase. And LD one plus 30 will become a divider. And then and then you say, LD two. Right. Okay. So now. Pre-a. Now then preparation. LD one you say pre-end. One. Okay. Right. So this is how you divide your slide vertically in our time. Line way, right? These are the four phases. Yeah. That what was Shashvadev shared with you? Something like that. Like one, two, rather than one and two, you can say LD one, pre-end. One or something. So pre-end. One is not a milestone, but LD one is a milestone, whatever is a space before. LD one is a pre-end. One phase. Yeah. Now once you have these four verticals, now you this is now you have divided your slide from vertical perspective to give it a view to everyone that these are the milestones. Now you start thinking about how you group it horizontal way. So what are the different groups you're going to put horizontally? Yes. I'll say at your systems perspective or in because the infrastructure is not entirely under. Take infrastructure maybe in the rubber view. So take infrastructure will go in a one lane and then. HR systems will go. Sure. We will become. What? The categorization what we are trying to move. So because infrastructure will be a lot of infrastructure. Right. So some infrastructure you can prepare. Re-end. So I mean for such a will go. Well, I did. Isn't how you should build like let's say I categorize. I know what you are saying that some of this would be spread throughout. Yeah. But let's say. What free and one and any one there needs to be a period of a vacation that this needs to happen in. And one this needs to happen. And then there might be a few things that will be spread out between let's say. From free and one to anyone. Us. Last. Can you see why we will start the camera and maybe you'll be able to see us. Yeah. And I don't know if you're able to see the. Too much. I think. Now okay. Now you can see. Yeah. Can you move the laptop near to the board? Yeah. What float you guys are sitting. We are on the radio. Seven. And we're going to be able to see. So let's see what I was saying is this. And. Or employing a one. You're saying let's say this is. And we want. This is. And you want. Now you say door somewhere. This is. Employee. One. Which is nothing but. And we won. Right now the option is 30. But can be 40 can be. You know anything but right now it's 30 for us. Something X. But we are calling it is a. One. We are one. And then you say somewhere is. And you do. Which is. Client. And. And. And this. This space is around. Three and you want. This one. Yeah. So this is how you want. Slide is. Now. You have. You have done some analysis. Yeah. How to project analysis that people can look at a strategy view. Of. What they need to do with different systems infrastructure and. Dependencies from other systems from outside tech as well. So they see in one picture how I can get this milestone done. Right. Yeah. So you have a number of systems as well. So what. So, what I was telling you is that we should have. Head charge systems. Here. That's going to. Impro-structured. So it in. So, it is there can be. In. In. In. In. Outside technology. I don't know. What. But. What. One. And. Other than it. For system. And. We have. We have. License. License. In. And. And. Because if you want my let's say Microsoft teams, what you're essentially saying is To have the teams ready for all the employees who's the non-world You need to have the licenses extra licenses for those teams that that's it Yeah Mainly the HR systems I'm focusing on all the HR related applications like success factor and All those things but licenses we have lot of applications So I Think we should do like what he has shown in the slides today So I think I'm going to go on the bottom you should put productivity I don't know if it is part of HR, but productivity tools You know right and then you can I don't know if Collaboration can be part of HR systems or can we have communication or for like internet We'll will internet come into product community Draw really or Asia Probably productivity and so then I team for the children bottom last D3 category are enough them So what about the internet apps like internal apps? Internet apps will come in productivity productivity includes your Communication F etc. I also Order definition doesn't surprise You Think it's gonna be different You have the reason for separating the license related group is they will work on procuring all the licenses as a batch for all those applications But can we say that is an external dependency like a vendor team because that's not a technology thing right? Yeah, I have this requirement of enabling teams vendor Procurement has to work on the licensing I think a lot worth they make contributions it, but it should be led by vendor and procurement team Okay, so that's that will come under productivity tools or The So this is Right you can highlight some of the dependencies on different other teams, but this is the tech view okay Well, what is the effort tech means to put to get to the idea one from their side and if there are dependencies on other teams You highlight those dependencies somewhere. Okay. Okay, so From HR perspective right you know you will not get any data right yeah You can do only prepared is from your side so what all things you can do from here to here with respect to HR systems and we don't need to specify like I have one key and all but from Assessment perspective from readiness perspective what all activity you're gonna put Between this and this so that then the legal day one hit now you have a liberty to migrate within certain time and you and they are employing They are here. Yeah, and they are access to a system Sure, okay, so something like this view right so From productivity tools perspective and then you can have some of the stars mark or some of the things you can say Color code there's and say and then put a note down somewhere that Tip and vendor or procurement Conversation or discussion required something like this one yeah, if it may not advance to anyone all these things need to happen the readiness on licenses Infrastructure readiness may be heard when you say infrastructure readiness you can highlight like I think for such a like some words media is you know, yeah, like that you can say readiness and then if they're earning other critical steps They need to know that can also be here Yeah, you put some nice tools like here at anyone You will have these all activities done Then you achieve these minds was then only you'll be able to achieve your environment testing yeah Now you can be specific with an interviewer and you can now Transfer some of the implied data and information around their employees can it to import employees like so you need to import Basic information you need to create their profile right profile creation of all those into these HR systems you need to Get some data on that then you need to create a From infrastructure perspective area counts This can be done before or after like Basic account rules can be done, but we don't want to get into too much detail But we have to show a logical view that all the critical elements are part of this view Yeah, and for this you can put some of the start marks saying that next slide can provide more details about the systems next slide can provide more about That's as you're ready. Yeah, but this has to be very high level one you yeah You can see how can I migrate myself? How can this is my and then in this in this part You can also say some of the things around war let's say you're talking about all the payroll doesn't need to become it Like some parts of the payroll can come and then you can say you're Around Which is the payroll system One thing yeah, I want these are also dependent on Keep 24 there is a interdependencies on different systems like MDM It is going from there G.A. level first so these systems can go you know, but later So use the information that you have currently Supporter this thing sure. Yeah, doesn't it? Yeah, I was thinking in a similar line the nine month plan What you said I was thinking about to do it in this fashion only the only the question I have is do I need to mention the nine months timeline on the no Not for no, okay Yeah, what what we need to get is what Like task or effort is required for this Right, and then we decide that to do that task if it will take five months nine months or ten months Okay Yeah Okay, yeah, this is good so I will start looking into that But this deck we don't need this right maybe for next week we need to get But but I need to see this view by this week. Yeah, yeah, we are getting anxious. What are we doing? Yeah, yeah, I will do that. Can you take one picture of this because from laptop So We have called in five minutes Okay, what else anything else does it help? Yeah, this is helpful So they yeah, I will work on that Okay, and you have the diagram you have the architecture you have the excels that they have so they have put together a lot of information for us I think it's now The whole work on the why we are getting paid is how we consolidate that information for executives Uh, based on our experiences to show that this is what we think is the right Land for you that can be achievable within let's say 60 days or 300 days or whatever Yeah, okay, because because what they have done is a ground level work for you They have provided all the information they have interdependencies their systems Where they think data needs to be migrated where they think it's hired is lower they have done a lot of homework But our work is to consolidate in of you yeah, we don't want to show another analysis on their analysis right? Yeah, yeah, that is good for a appendix and support slides, but we need to show a high level view to them Yeah, so take a stab at it. Yeah, I would say I would again the same comment that I was Telling to Jocelyn as well It has to be a light documentary. It cannot be like I'm working on it in next two days.
